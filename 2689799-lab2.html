            <p style="padding: 0 10px; text-align: center;">Hi, I'm Boaz, a Computer Science student with a passion for technology and problem-solving. I'm currently working on developing my skills in programming, software development, and algorithms. I enjoy taking on new challenges and learning about different areas of tech, from web development to machine learning. Outside of my studies, I like to explore open-source projects, collaborate with others, and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in tech. I'm excited to continue growing my knowledge and contributing to innovative projects in the field.</p>

            <h3 style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">Latest Project</h3>
            <p>One of the projects I'm most proud of is a web application I developed as part of my studies. The project involved building a fully functional platform that allows users to manage and track their tasks efficiently. I used a combination of front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with a back-end framework to handle user data and interactions. Throughout the project, I focused on creating a clean, user-friendly interface and ensuring a smooth user experience. It was a great opportunity to apply my skills in full-stack development and learn about the complexities of working with databases and server-side logic. The project not only sharpened my technical skills but also helped me understand the importance of good project management and teamwork.</p>
